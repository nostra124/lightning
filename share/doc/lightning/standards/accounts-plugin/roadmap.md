# `accounts` — custodial accounts: feature plan & roadmap

**Status:** Proposal / planning (no code yet)
**Owner:** rene
**Target:** lift the account / commerce ("neobank") surface out of the
`lightning` package into Rust.

> **MERGED INTO `thunderd`.** This is now the **custodial-accounts tier
> (Phase I)** of the `thunderd` engine — see `../thunderd/design.md` and
> `../roadmap-overview.md`. The change vs. the original plan: the
> custodial logic ships as a **module of the `thunderd` companion
> daemon** (driving `lightningd` over the Unix RPC socket + `waitanyinvoice`
> for settlement), **not** as a separate in-process CLN plugin. It still
> owns its state and uses direct `lightningd` RPC exactly as the "fat
> plugin" would have, so the feature breakdown below stands; the
> milestones M0–M6 are `thunderd` **Phase I**. Where this doc says
> "plugin", read "thunderd custodial module".

## 1. Why

`lightning` started as a thin CLI in front of Core Lightning. It has
since grown a full account-and-commerce stack — anonymous accounts keyed
by a bech32 address, a double-entry msat ledger, commercial invoices
(Skonto / late-fee terms), standing orders (Dauerauftrag), direct-debit
mandates (Lastschrift), an escrow/auth-capture charge lifecycle,
tax export, referrals, an operator fee model, and a compliance hook
layer. That surface is reached over HTTP at
`/.well-known/lightning/v1/accounts/*` via four layers: Apache → Python
CGI → `sudo`-to-operator → `api-account-*` bash verbs → `sqlite3` +
`lightning-cli`.

This is no longer "simple lightning administration." It is a product of
its own, and it bloats the wallet CLI it lives inside. **We want to carve
it out** into a single Core Lightning plugin you install on the node —
named **`accounts`**, because that is what it offers — with a generic
URL scheme:

```
/.well-known/lightning/<plugin>/<version>     ← convention
/.well-known/lightning/accounts/v1            ← this plugin
```

Apache (or any reverse proxy) does TLS + a one-line `ProxyPass`; the
plugin owns everything behind it.

## 2. Goals / non-goals

**Goals**
- One installable CLN plugin, written in **Rust** (`cln-plugin` +
  `cln-rpc`), that serves the accounts/commerce JSON API over HTTP.
- **Fat architecture:** the plugin talks to `lightningd` directly over
  JSON-RPC and **owns its own state DB** — no `lightning-cli`, no
  `sudo`-bridge, no `api-account-*` bash verbs at runtime.
- **Factor-out-ready:** zero runtime coupling to the `lightning`
  package. The plugin depends only on *standard* CLN RPC, so the
  directory can later be `git filter-repo`'d into its own repo
  (`cln-accounts`) and shipped independently.
- Behaviour parity with today's `/.well-known/lightning/v1/accounts/*`
  surface (same routes, same auth, same status-code contract).

**Non-goals (for this initiative)**
- The other `/.well-known/lightning/` surfaces — `price`, `node`,
  `decode`, `channels`, `node-funds`, `health`, `lnurlp`, the `users`
  passkey layer, `liquidity`. They stay where they are (CGI) and keep
  their own URLs. The passkey/user layer (FEAT-222) is a *candidate* for
  a separate future plugin, not part of this carve-out.
- On-chain ops, lnd/phoenixd — out of scope per `CLAUDE.md`.
- Re-implementing the operator's *wallet* CLI. `lightning` stays the
  operator's admin tool; it just sheds the commerce stack.

## 3. Target architecture

```
HTTP client (PWA / merchant POS / webhook / MCP agent)
   │  Authorization: Bearer lt_…  (or X-Mandate-Secret)
   ▼
Apache / nginx  —  TLS + ProxyPass /.well-known/lightning/accounts/ → 127.0.0.1:<port>/
   ▼
accounts plugin  (Rust, subprocess of lightningd)
   ├─ HTTP listener        (axum/hyper, localhost-bound)        — like clnrest
   ├─ router + authz       (bearer / mandate-secret, rate-limit)
   ├─ business logic       (accounts, ledger, invoices, mandates, charges, …)
   ├─ owned state          (SQLite: accounts/commerce schema + migrations)
   └─ node integration     (cln-rpc: invoice, pay, newaddr, offer, listfunds, …)
        │  JSON-RPC over the lightning-rpc unix socket
        ▼
   lightningd
```

Architectural template is **clnrest** (CLN's own Rust plugin that binds
an HTTP/WebSocket gateway). We follow the same shape: `cln-plugin` for
the lifecycle + options, an embedded async HTTP server, `cln-rpc` for
node calls.

### 3.1 Plugin options (manifest)
- `accounts-http-bind` (default `127.0.0.1`) — listener address.
- `accounts-http-port` (default e.g. `9737`) — listener port.
- `accounts-db` — path to the plugin's SQLite file (default under the
  node's lightning-dir, e.g. `accounts.sqlite3`).
- `accounts-base-path` (default `/.well-known/lightning/accounts/v1`) —
  the path prefix the proxy strips, used for self-links.
- Policy config (fees, referral split, compliance, capability defaults,
  create rate-limit) — see §6.

### 3.2 URL scheme & discovery
- All routes under `/.well-known/lightning/accounts/v1/…`, parity with
  today's `…/v1/accounts/…` tail.
- The plugin serves its own discovery docs:
  `…/accounts/versions.json` and (if MCP is kept) `…/accounts/mcp.json`.
- **Back-compat:** during transition, Apache also points the old
  `/.well-known/lightning/v1/accounts` prefix at the plugin (or 301s to
  the new path) so existing clients don't break.

## 4. The carve-out boundary (most important design call)

The plugin must be self-contained. The hard part is **state ownership**:
today the `accounts` and `ledger` tables are *shared* between the bash
verbs (operator CLI) and the HTTP API.

Decision for the fat plugin: **the plugin owns the commerce/account
state** (`accounts`, `ledger`, `commerce_invoices`, `standing_orders`,
`mandates`, `mandate_pulls`, `commerce_charges`, `commerce_events`,
`invite_codes`, `prices`, plus its own `apikeys`). The operator CLI's
relationship to that data becomes one of:

- **(a) Read-only via the plugin** — `lightning account …` admin verbs
  call the plugin's RPC/HTTP instead of touching the DB. Cleanest
  boundary; preferred end-state.
- **(b) Frozen** — operator account-admin moves into the plugin (e.g.
  `lightning-cli accounts-admin …` registered RPC methods), and the old
  `account` verb is deprecated.

Either way the runtime dependency arrow points **one way** (CLI →
plugin), never plugin → `lightning`. That is what makes the later repo
extraction a mechanical move.

**Migration:** a one-shot importer reads the existing wallet
`state.db` and copies the commerce/account rows into the plugin DB
(idempotent, re-runnable, with a dry-run). Ships as `accounts-migrate`.

## 5. Security model change (must be designed in, not bolted on)

Today's safety comes from Unix-user isolation (`www-data` can't move
money; only `sudo`-to-`alice` can). A fat plugin runs **in lightningd's
trust domain** and can move real funds. So every guardrail the OS gave
us for free now lives *inside* the plugin and must be airtight:

- Bearer tokens + mandate secrets hashed at rest; constant-time compare.
- HTTP listener bound to localhost only; TLS terminated by the proxy.
- In-plugin rate-limiting (account-create, auth attempts).
- Overdraft / limit / capability checks enforced before any RPC `pay`.
- Compliance pre-hook can veto a money-move before it reaches the node.
- The exit-code contract (`6`→402, `7`→401, backend→502) becomes a typed
  `Result` → HTTP status mapping; keep the same external behaviour.

## 6. Cross-cutting policy that MUST be preserved (port, don't drop)

These live in the bash verbs today and are easy to lose in a rewrite:
- **Operator fee skim** (FEAT-213) — base_sat + rate_ppm to `house`.
- **Referral split** (FEAT-219) — % to the referrer chain.
- **Compliance hooks + audit** (FEAT-233) — `compliance_events`.
- **Capability profiles / gates** (FEAT-243) — `treasury|family|
  prepaid|custodial`, own/foreign fund class.
- **System accounts** — `house`, `escrow`, `others`, `-` and their
  overdraft=allow semantics.
- **Double-entry, msat-precision** atomic ledger moves.

Each becomes a Rust module with its own tests and a golden-output test
against the current verb behaviour.

## 7. Roadmap (phases & feature epics)

Phases are sequenced so the plugin is **shippable and shadow-testable
early**, with cutover late. Feature numbers `FEAT-3xx` are *proposed*
placeholders (continue the repo's FEAT-### sequence when filed); the
`from:` notes the existing feature/verb being ported.

### Phase 0 — Foundations
- **FEAT-300 — Plugin skeleton.** Rust crate at `plugin/accounts/`,
  `cln-plugin` lifecycle, manifest options (§3.1), `getmanifest`/`init`
  handshake, a `accounts-health` RPC method, structured logging.
- **FEAT-301 — Build & install wiring.** `cargo build --release` hooked
  into `make install`; install the binary to `libexec/lightning/` (or a
  `plugins/` dir) and document `plugin=` / `lightning-cli plugin start`.
  Keep the crate buildable standalone (its own `Cargo.toml` workspace
  root) for the eventual extraction.
- **FEAT-302 — Carve-out guardrail.** CI check that the crate has no
  build/runtime dependency on `lightning` bash verbs or the wallet DB
  path — enforces the one-way boundary from day one.

### Phase 1 — HTTP server + routing parity
- **FEAT-303 — Embedded HTTP listener.** axum/hyper server bound per
  §3.1; health + 404/405 behaviour; request-body limits.
- **FEAT-304 — Router & auth.** Port `accounts.py`'s dispatch
  (PATH_INFO → handler), `_lib.py` bearer + mandate-secret auth, the
  status-code contract. Stub handlers return `501` until Phase 4.
- **FEAT-305 — Discovery.** Serve `versions.json`; reverse-proxy
  fragment for Apache/nginx (`ProxyPass`), replacing the CGI
  `ScriptAlias` block. Back-compat alias for the old URL.

### Phase 2 — State layer (carve-out core)
- **FEAT-306 — Owned schema + migrations.** Embed the commerce/account
  schema; versioned, idempotent migrations (sqlx/rusqlite + refinery or
  hand-rolled). WAL mode.
- **FEAT-307 — Ledger engine.** Double-entry, msat, atomic transfers;
  system accounts; balance/overdraft/limit primitives. Property tests
  (sum invariants) + golden tests vs. the bash ledger.
- **FEAT-308 — Importer (`accounts-migrate`).** One-shot, idempotent,
  dry-run import from the existing wallet `state.db`.

### Phase 3 — Node integration (direct RPC)
- **FEAT-309 — cln-rpc wiring.** `invoice` (recv), `pay` (pay), `newaddr`
  (account-id mint + topup target), `listfunds`/`bkpr-*` (balances),
  `decode`. Replace every `lightning-cli` shell-out.
- **FEAT-310 — Settlement reconciliation.** Subscribe to
  `invoice_payment` / `waitanyinvoice`; book settlements to the ledger;
  FEAT-244-style `others` reconciliation for external flows.
- **FEAT-311 — BOLT-12.** `offer` (recv-reusable), `fetchinvoice`+`pay`
  (pay to offer).
- **FEAT-312 — Withdraw / submarine swap.** Decision: native Boltz HTTP
  client in Rust vs. the single sanctioned shell-out to `boltzcli`.
  (Flagged as an open decision — see §8.)

### Phase 4 — Business features (port each verb family)
Each ports a verb family into a Rust module + handler, behind the
already-wired routes:
- **FEAT-313 — Accounts CRUD** (create/list/balance/topup/close/api-key/
  describe). *from FEAT-212, 286, 287, 249.*
- **FEAT-314 — Payments** (pay/recv/recv-reusable/transfer/withdraw).
  *from FEAT-212, 223.*
- **FEAT-315 — Commercial invoices** (terms: Skonto/late-fee; references;
  effective-amount recompute). *from FEAT-225.*
- **FEAT-316 — Standing orders + in-plugin runner.** The cron/sidecar
  becomes a plugin timer task. *from FEAT-226.*
- **FEAT-317 — Mandates / direct debit** (create/patch/revoke, charge by
  secret, pulls + approve/deny). *from FEAT-227, 231.*
- **FEAT-318 — Commerce charges** (hold/release, authorize/capture/void,
  refund, installments, dunning) + `commerce_events`. *from FEAT-228.*
- **FEAT-319 — History, notes, tax export** (CSV/JSON, fiat valuation per
  ts). *from FEAT-230, 246, 254.*
- **FEAT-320 — Referrals & invite codes.** *from FEAT-218, 219, 220.*

### Phase 5 — Cross-cutting policy
- **FEAT-321 — Fee skim + referral split** (§6).
- **FEAT-322 — Compliance hooks + audit** (§6).
- **FEAT-323 — Capability profiles / fund class** (§6).
- **FEAT-324 — Rate-limiting** (account-create + auth).

### Phase 6 — Surface extras (optional)
- **FEAT-325 — MCP server** re-exposed from the plugin (`mcp.json` +
  JSON-RPC tools), if we keep it on this surface. *from FEAT-212 MCP.*

### Phase 7 — Cutover
- **FEAT-326 — Shadow run.** Plugin live alongside the CGI; compare
  responses on a mirrored path; fix drift.
- **FEAT-327 — Flip the proxy.** Apache `ProxyPass` to the plugin; old
  URL 301s to the new one.
- **FEAT-328 — Retire the old layer.** Delete `api-account-*` verbs, the
  `wellknown/api/accounts.py` dispatcher + commerce `_lib.py` paths, the
  CGI Apache block; trim the shared `state.db` schema; update man pages
  (`CLAUDE.md` §9) and `share/doc/.../api/spec.md`. **This is the step
  that shrinks `lightning` back toward "simple administration."**

### Phase 8 — Factor out
- **FEAT-329 — Extract repo.** `git filter-repo` `plugin/accounts/` into
  `cln-accounts` with its own `.rpk`, CI, semver. `lightning` either
  bundles it as a build dep or it installs independently. The boundary
  built in Phase 0–2 makes this mechanical.

---

## 8. Open decisions (need your call before/within Phase 0–3)
1. **Operator-CLI ↔ plugin coupling** (§4): admin via plugin RPC
   *(a, preferred)* vs. freeze admin into the plugin *(b)*.
2. **Withdraw** (FEAT-312): native Rust Boltz client vs. one sanctioned
   `boltzcli` shell-out.
3. **MCP** (FEAT-325): port to the plugin now, later, or drop from this
   surface.
4. **DB engine/crate**: `rusqlite` (sync, simple) vs. `sqlx` (async,
   compile-time-checked) for the async axum server.
5. **In-tree path & workspace**: confirm `plugin/accounts/` as the crate
   home and a workspace root that survives extraction.

## 9. What stays the same
- clightning-only backend (`CLAUDE.md` §1).
- The external contract: routes, bearer auth, the `6→402 / 7→401 /
  →502` status mapping, JSON in/out.
- Reverse proxy does TLS only; no business logic in Apache.

---

## 10. Milestones & sequencing corrections (planning round 2)

This is **Track A** in the wider plan — see `../roadmap-overview.md` for
how it relates to the PWA carve-out (Track B) and `thunderd` (Track C).

### 10.1 Milestone map

| Milestone | Theme | Features | Exit criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| **M0 — Skeleton** `v0.1` | Plugin loads & serves | 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305 | Installs into CLN, HTTP up, routed + bearer/mandate auth (handlers 501-stub), carve-out CI guard green, proxy fragment, **CORS scaffold** |
| **M1 — Core engine** `v0.2` | State + node + policy *hooks* | 306, 307, 308, 309, 310 **+ policy middleware seam** | Owned DB & migrations, double-entry ledger, importer, `cln-rpc` wired, settlement; `balance` real; fee/compliance/capability hook points exist |
| **M2 — Wallet parity** `v0.3` | Move money | 313, 314, 311, 312 | accounts CRUD + pay/recv/recv-reusable/transfer/withdraw end-to-end, **each routed through the policy hooks** |
| **M3 — Commerce** `v0.4` | Neobank surface | 315, 316, 317, 318, 319, 320 | invoices, standing orders, mandates, charges, history/tax, referrals |
| **M4 — Policy hardening** `v0.5` | Finish guardrails | 321, 322, 323, 324 | fee skim, compliance audit, capability profiles, rate-limit fully enforced |
| **M5 — Extras** `v0.6` | optional/parallel | 325 | MCP surface re-exposed |
| **M6 — Cutover** `v1.0` | Retire old layer | 326, 327, 328 | shadow-run → flip proxy → delete CGI + `api-account-*` verbs; `lightning` slimmed back to admin |
| **M7 — Extraction** `v1.x` | Own repo | 329 | `cln-accounts` repo, independent versioning |

**Critical path:** M0 → M1 → M2 → M3 → M6 → M7. M4 hardens what M2/M3
establish; M5 is parallel/optional.

### 10.2 Corrections to §7

- **Policy is a foundational seam, not a late phase.** §7 lists the
  cross-cutting policy (fees/compliance/capabilities, 321–323) *after*
  the money features. That is wrong for a real node — every money-moving
  verb today already enforces overdraft, capability gates and the
  compliance-deny hook, so shipping M2 without them would bypass the
  operator's loss-prevention and revenue. **Land the policy hook points
  (middleware) in M1, plug each feature into them in M2/M3, and use M4
  only to flesh out the full rule set + audit.**
- **CORS is a new requirement** introduced by the PWA carve-out (Track
  B). Once the PWA can be served from a different origin, the plugin must
  support an explicit **CORS origin-allowlist + preflight**, and the
  bearer token travels cross-origin. Land the scaffold in M0 and the
  allowlist in M1. The default/recommended deploy stays **same-origin**
  (plugin may bundle + serve the PWA); cross-origin is opt-in.
